         <p class="text">My name is Mark Reifke. I currently live in San Tan Valley, AZ.
                         In August of 2018, I went overseas to Kuwait and worked for 2 years as a Force Protection Officer.
                         Within 4 months of working, I got selected and put into a specialty group. While working in that group 
                         I got to meet a lot of other contractors that worked within the IT field. While getting to know them
                         and talking with them I started to really get an interest for computer coding and how it all works. 
                         I came home in July of 2020 and took some time off to spend with family and just relax from getting home. 
                         I started to talk to my brother-in-law who currently works in the computer coding field and found out 
                         about these Coding Bootcamps. I knew I wanted to get into some field to do with computers. I've always had 
                         a passion for computers and working on them. I just never knew what I really wanted to do with it. That's when
                         I enrolled in the UofA coding bootcamp to take the leap into a new and exciting career field and something I 
                         have a passion for. 
         </p>
         <p class="text">Then the unfortunate happened and in January of 2021 I tested positive for Covid-19 and had to quit my job at 
                         Home Depot as Asset Protection so I could recover from Covid and all the side effects from it. That showed me that I needed 
                         to have a career that I could work remotely if needed and be more stable and safe.                                  
         </p>  
         <p class="text">Im looking forward to what the future has instore and what I'm going to learn from school and advancing in a 
                         career in coding.
